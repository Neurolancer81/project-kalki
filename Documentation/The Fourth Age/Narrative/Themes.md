# Themes

Core philosophical and emotional ideas driving the story.

**Prompt ideas**
- Fate vs. Free Will  
- Cycles of creation and decay  
- Duty, Dharma, and rebellion  
- Knowledge as both salvation and curse

**Question:**  
How do systems (like the Journal) reinforce these ideas mechanically?
