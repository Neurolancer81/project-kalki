# Player Experience

## Core fantasy
Lead a band of seekers through fragmented kingdoms and divine intrigue—  
where *every action is logged by fate itself*.

## Primary loops
1. **Exploration loop:** Move, interact, discover → trigger events → update Journal.  
2. **Combat loop:** Plan → Act → Resolve → Log → Reward.  
3. **Social loop:** Converse → Check → Branch → Consequences logged.  
4. **Overworld loop:** Travel → Encounter → Rest → Journal snapshot.

## Emotional beats
- Strategic satisfaction from deterministic systems.  
- Wonder through cultural depth & stylized visuals.  
- Ownership via persistent Journal record.
