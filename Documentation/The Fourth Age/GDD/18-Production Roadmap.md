# Production Roadmap

## Milestones
| Phase | Focus | Key Deliverable |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| M0 | Setup & Framework | Base project, tags, subsystems |
| M1 | Combat Core | TB system + Journal logging |
| M2 | RTwP Layer | Time dilation + Player-AI |
| M3 | Exploration | Hub + interaction logging |
| M4 | Overworld | Travel + snapshot system |
| M5 | Content | Companion, arenas, abilities |
| M6 | Multiplayer | TB co-op prototype |
| M7 | Cinematics | Sequencer + MetaHumans polish |

## Risks
- GAS complexity → start minimal.  
- Scope creep → limit cinematics.  
- Storage growth → event compaction jobs.
